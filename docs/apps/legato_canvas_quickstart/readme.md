This application shows how to use Canvas with Legato graphics library. A black rectangle is displayed with a logo and some fonts in layer one. This screen can be moved around with a swipe gesture using Canvas. Layer two has a grey panel with a button. Pressing the button moves the black rectangle back to home position.
