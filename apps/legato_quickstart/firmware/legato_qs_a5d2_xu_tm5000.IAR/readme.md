Defining the Architecture
-------------------------

![](../../../../docs/html/legato_sam9x60_single_buffer_arch.png)

This application demonstrates multi-layer, basic graphics canvas integeration, WVGA graphics using SDRAM memory.

User touch input on the display panel is received thru the PCAP capacitive touch controller, which sends a notification to the Touch Input Driver. The Touch Input Driver reads the touch information over I2C and sends the touch event to the Graphics Library thru the Input System Service.

### Demonstration Features

-   Legato Graphics Library and Graphics Canvas
-   Reference application for the SAM A5D2
-   24-bit color, multi-layer, WVGA (800x480) screen design
-   Time system service, timer-counter peripheral library and driver 
-   Graphics Acceleration using integrated display controller (LCDC)
-   I2C and touch controller driver 

Creating the Project Graph
--------------------------

![](../../../../docs/html/legato_sama5d2_single_buffer_arch.png)

The Project Graph diagram shows the Harmony components that are included in this application. Lines between components are drawn to satisfy components that depend on a capability that another component provides.

Adding the **SAM A5D2 Xplained Ultra BSP** and **Legato Graphics w/ PDA TM5000 Display** Graphics Template component into the project graph will automatically add the components needed for a graphics project and resolve their dependencies. It will also configure the pins needed to drive the external peripherals like the display and the touch controller.

Building the Application
------------------------

The parent directory for this application is gfx/apps/legato\_quickstart. To build this application, use MPLAB X IDE to open the gfx/apps/legato\_quickstart/firmware/legato\_qs\_a5d2\_xu\_tm5000.X project file.

The following table lists configuration properties:

|Project Name|BSP Used|Graphics Template Used|Description|
|:-----------|:-------|:---------------------|:----------|
|legato\_qs\_a5d2\_xu\_tm5000.X|SAM A5D2 Xplained Ultra|Legato Graphics w/ PDA TM5000 Display|SAM A5D2 Xplained Ultra with RGBA8888 GFX Interface and 5" WVGA PCAP Touch display|

> \*\*\_NOTE:\_\*\* This application may contain custom code that is marked by the comments // START OF CUSTOM CODE ... and // END OF CUSTOM CODE. When using the MPLAB Harmony Configurator to regenerate the application code, use the "ALL" merging strategy and do not remove or replace the custom code.

Configuring the Hardware
------------------------

The final setup should be:

Configure the hardware as follows:

-   Connect the ribbon cable from the display to the LCD connector on the back of the SAM A5D2 Xplained Ultra board.
-   Power up the board by connecting the power adapter to power connector or a powered USB cable to the USB port on the SAM A5D2 Xplained Ultra board.


Running the Demonstration
-------------------------

When power-on is successful, the demonstration will display a similar menu to that shown in the following figure (different configurations may have slight variation in the screen aspect ratio):
