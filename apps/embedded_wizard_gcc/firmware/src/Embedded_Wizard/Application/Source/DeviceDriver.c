* DESCRIPTION:
*   This file implements an interface between an Embedded Wizard generated UI
*   application and a certain device. Please consider this file only as template
*   that is intended to show the binding between an UI application and the
*   underlying system (e.g. middleware, BSP, hardware driver, protocol, ...).
*
*   This device driver is the counterpart to a device class implemented within
*   your Embedded Wizard project.
*
*   Feel free to adapt this file according your needs!
*
*   The following code demonstrates the access to the board LED, a simulated
*   ADC value and the hardware button. Furthemore, the console interface is used
*   to print a string.
*
*   The Embedded Wizard GUI example 'DeviceIntegration' shows the usage of this
*   device driver.
*
*   This file assumes to be the counterpart of the device class 'DeviceClass'
*   within the unit 'Application'.
