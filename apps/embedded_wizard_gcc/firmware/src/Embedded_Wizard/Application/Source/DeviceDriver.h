* DESCRIPTION:
*   This file implements an interface between an Embedded Wizard generated UI
*   application and a certain device. Please consider this file only as template
*   that is intended to show the binding between an UI application and the
*   underlying system (e.g. middleware, BSP, hardware driver, protocol, ...).
*
*   This device driver is the counterpart to a device class implemented within
*   your Embedded Wizard project.
*
*   Feel free to adapt this file according your needs!
*
*   The following code demonstrates the access to the board LED, a simulated
*   ADC value and the hardware button. Furthemore, the console interface is used
*   to print a string.
*
*   The Embedded Wizard GUI example 'DeviceIntegration' shows the usage of this
*   device driver.
*
*   This file assumes to be the counterpart of the device class 'DeviceClass'
*   within the unit 'Application'.

* DESCRIPTION:
*   The function DeviceDriver_Initialize() initializes the module and prepares all

*   The function has to be called from your main module, before the initialization
*   of your GUI application.
*
*   IMPORTANT NOTE: This global initialization function exists for compatibility
*   reasons. The initialization of dedicated hardware drivers or middleware APIs
*   should be done in separate functions called by the Init constructor of the
*   device class.
*
* ARGUMENTS:
*   None
*
* RETURN VALUE:
*   None

* FUNCTION:

*
* DESCRIPTION:
*   The function DeviceDriver_Deinitialize() deinitializes the module and
*   finalizes the access or communication with the real device.
*   The function has to be called from your main module, after the GUI
*   application will be deinitialized.
*
*   IMPORTANT NOTE: This global de-initialization function exists for
*   compatibility reasons. It is recommend to use the Done destructor of the
*   device class.

/*******************************************************************************
* FUNCTION:
*   DeviceDriver_ProcessData
*
* DESCRIPTION:
*   The function DeviceDriver_ProcessData() is called from the main UI loop, in
*   order to process data and events from your particular device.
*   This function is responsible to update properties within the device class
*   if the corresponding state or value of the real device has changed.
*   This function is also responsible to trigger system events if necessary.
*
*   IMPORTANT NOTE: This data processing function can be used to process data
*   periodically in the context of the main GUI thread/task or in case there
*   is no operating system at all (bare metal).
*   In case you want to feed the GUI application with data and events from a
*   foreign thread/task or an interrupt service routine it will be much easier
*   to use the functions EwInvoke() and EwInvokeCopy().
*
* ARGUMENTS:
*   None
*
* RETURN VALUE:
*   The function returns a non-zero value if a property has changed or if a
*   system event was triggered. If nothing happens, the function returns 0.
