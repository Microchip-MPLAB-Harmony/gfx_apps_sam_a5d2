* DESCRIPTION:
*   This is an internal header of the Embedded Wizard Graphics Engine EWGFX. It
*   declares the platform independent interface to an external bitmap and font
*   resource provider. In Embedded Wizard the access to resources is handled
*   separately by platform specific provider functionality. Depending on the
*   manner to store bitmap and font resources, the provider has the job to find,
*   open, decompress, load, etc. the desired bitmap or font.
*
*   The provider consists of two interfaces:
*
*   1. Bitmap loader. Its intention is to access and load bitmaps, images, etc.
*      Depending on the provider implementation, the bitmaps can be loaded from
*      the code memory or from an external storage medium.
*
*   2. Font loader. Its intention is to access and load fonts and glyphs.
*      Depending on the provider implementation, true type fonts can be opened
*      or pre-rasterized glyphs can be decompressed from the code memory.
*
*   Usually, a loader interface will consist of a header and an implementation
*   files, whose names are predetermined in order to allow the Graphics Engine
*   to access them independent of the particular target system:
*
*   > ewextbmp.h + ewextbmp.c -> for bitmap resource loader.
*
*   > ewextfnt.h + ewextfnt.c -> for font resource loader.

*
*   Please note: this function allows the caller to flexibly create fonts on

*
* ARGUMENTS:
*   aName        - A unique name of the TrueType font stored as zero terminated
*     ASCII string (e.g. "Arial"). The function limits the evaluation to the
*     first 31 characters from the string.
*   aHeight      - The desired height of the font in pixel.
*   aBold        - This parameter determines, whether a bold or a normal style
*     of the font should be used at the runtime. A bold font will be used if
*     this parameter contains a value != 0.
*   aItalic      - This parameter determines, whether an italic or a normal
*     style of the font should be used at the runtime. An italic font is used
*     if this parameter contains a value != 0.
*   aAspectRatio - The AspectRatio parameter defines the desired aspect ratio
*     of the font in the range from 0.25 to 4.0. The default value is 1.0 - in
*     this case the aspect ratio of the font corresponds to the origin design
*     of the font.
*   aNoOfColors  - Desired quality of the font glyphs to raster. Only the 
*     values 2, 4 or 16 are valid.
*   aKerning     - Determines whether kerning data should be used for this
*     font. In such case the value has to be != 0.
*   aRowDistance - The desired distance between two consecutive text rows. If
*     the value is == 0, the distance is calculated on the base of the font
*     metrics.
*   aPopularMode - If != 0, calculate the font size similarly to how other

*     Wizard version is used.
*
* RETURN VALUE:

/*******************************************************************************
* FUNCTION:
*   EwFntShapeCluster
*
* DESCRIPTION:
*   The function EwFntShapeCluster() is called by the Graphics Engine in order
*   to evaluate the text (aCharCodes) looking for the next indivisible unit
*   (cluster) and convert the character codes in corresponding glyph ids. The
*   glyph ids are then returned in the array aGlyphIds.
*
*   Depending on the text found in aCharCodes and features available in the
*   font, the function may apply diverse reordering and substitution steps so
*   the returned glyphs represent the original text formatted correctly. This
*   functionality is known as 'layout shaping' or 'complex text layout'. For
*   example, the function may convert a sequence of character codes to a unique
*   glyph id representing a ligature of those characters.
*   
* ARGUMENTS:
*   aHandle        - Handle to the font resource to process the characters and
*     estimate the right glyph ids.
*   aCharCodes     - An array containing the original text as Unicode code
*     points. The maximum number of characters in this array, the function may
*     process, is determined by the parameter aNoOfCharCodes.
*     Usually, the storage order of character codes corresponds to the order
*     in which the characters are rendered on the screen from left to right.
*     This can be modified by the parameter aDirection.
*   aNoOfCharCodes - Number of characters provided in the array aCharCodes.
*   aDirection     - Provides information about the order of how characters
*     in the aCharCodes array should be evaluated. If aDirection is 0 (zero),
*     the characters are stored in the order corresponding to how the glyphs
*     are rendered from left to right direction. If aDirection is != 0, the
*     codes are stored in reversed order. This means the first character is
*     displayed on the right of the second character.
*   aGlyphIds      - An array where resulting glyph ids are stored. The
*     parameter aNoOfGlyphIds determines the capacity of this array.
*   aDeltasOriginX - An array where horizontal displacement of the resulting
*     glyphs is stored. The parameter aNoOfGlyphIds determines the capacity
*     of this array.
*   aDeltasOriginY - An array where vertical displacement of the resulting
*     glyphs is stored. The parameter aNoOfGlyphIds determines the capacity
*     of this array.
*   aDeltasAdvance - An array where horizontal displacement of the following
*     glyph position is stored. The parameter aNoOfGlyphIds determines the
*     capacity of this array.
*   aNoOfGlyphIds  - As input parameter determines the capacity of the arrays
*     aGlyphIds, aGlyphXOffsets and aGlyphYOffsets. When the function has
*     finished the processing, the parameter will store how many glyphs and
*     offsets are available in the arrays aGlyphIds, aDeltasOriginX,
*     aDeltasOriginY and aDeltasAdvance.
*   aLineEnd       - If there is a potential line end after the just shaped
*     cluster, the variable referred by aLineEnd is initialized with a value
*     != 0. If there is no line break candidate between the processed cluster
*     and next following cluster, value 0 is assigned to the variable.
*   aContext       - Handle to the shaper context containing the information
*     collected during the process of the preceding cluster. This information
*     can be used when processing a new cluster. EwFntShapeCluster() should
*     thereupon update the context.
*
* RETURN VALUE:
*   The function returns how many character codes from the array aCharCodes
*   haven been processed. If the function couldn't even process a single
*   character, the returned value is 0.
