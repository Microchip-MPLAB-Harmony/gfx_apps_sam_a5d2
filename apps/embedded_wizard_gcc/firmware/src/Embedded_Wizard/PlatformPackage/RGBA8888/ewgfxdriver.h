* DESCRIPTION:
*   This is an internal header of the Embedded Wizard Graphics Engine EWGFX.
*
*   The module 'ewgfxdriver' implements the platform independent layer to the
*   software pixel driver. Its functionality provides a kind of reserve in case
*   the underlying graphics subsystem can not handle the necessary operations.
*   For example, if there is no support for index8 surfaces, 'ewgfxdriver' will
*   recompense it by a software emulated index8 surface including all necessary
*   drawing operations.
*
*   This header file provides a generic and platform independent interface to
*   the software pixel driver functionality. The interface consists of two
*   categories of functions:
*
*   1. 'per row' worker functions. These functions build the low-level software
*      pixel driver. They are intended to perform drawing operations optimized
*      for the particular pixel format and the drawing mode. The declarations,
*      any way, are platform independent.
*
*   2. 'per area' drawing functions. These functions provide the top-level view
*      to the software pixel driver. They are intended to drive the 'per row'
*      worker functions for the affected fill/copy/warp operation. When called,
*      the top-level function will receive a pointer to one of the low-level
*      worker functions. The passed worker function can be used thereupon to
*      perform row-wise the operation without any dependency to the underlying
*      pixel format.
*
*   Additionally, the header file provides generic declarations to simplify
*   the integration of external graphics subsystem drivers into the Embedded
*   Wizard Graphics Engine.

* MACRO:
*   EW_PIXEL_FORMAT_XXX
*
* DESCRIPTION:
*   The following enumeration defines the 3 fundamental surface formats. They
*   are needed amongst other things to specify the desired pixel format, when
*   creating new surfaces or when accessing surface memory directly.
*
* ELEMENTS:
*   EW_PIXEL_FORMAT_SCREEN - Represents the pixel format of the frame buffer.
*     Usually this format corresponds to the EW_PIXEL_FORMAT_NATIVE. In special
*     cases, however, it is necessary to distinguish between operations to run
*     on the frame buffer or on the normal (native) destination when these use
*     different color formats.
*     The pixel format does not make any assumption regarding the respective
*     color space, color channels, etc. In this manner the Graphics Engine
*     remains platform and color independent.
*     Please note, surfaces with this color format can serve as a destination
*     only in all drawing operations.
*   EW_PIXEL_FORMAT_NATIVE - Represents the main pixel format valid within the
*     particular graphics subsystem without any assumptions about the respective
*     color space, color channels, etc. This is the pixel format, the subsystem
*     is working with internally. In this manner the Graphics Engine remains
*     platform and color independent.
*     Please note, surfaces with this color format can serve as a destination
*     and source in all drawing operations.
*   EW_PIXEL_FORMAT_INDEX8 - Universal 8 bit per pixel CLUT format. This format
*     expects an additional color look-up table for translation between an 8 bit
*     index and the native color value.
*     Please note, surfaces with this color format can serve as a source only
*     in all drawing operations.
*   EW_PIXEL_FORMAT_ALPHA8 - Universal 8 bit per pixel alpha only format. Useful
*     as storage for glyphs, masks, etc.
*     Please note, surfaces with this color format can serve as a source only
*     in all drawing operations.
*   EW_PIXEL_FORMAT_RGB565 - Represents a color-only pixel format with 16-bit
*     per pixel. The support for this format is optional depending on the used
*     target system and the Native color format in the target system.
*     Please note, surfaces with this color format can serve as a source only
*     in all drawing operations.

*
*   DoesSupportCompression           - != 0 if the Graphics Engine does support
*     compressed bitmap resources. If the feature is removed from the Graphics

*     support for surfaces (bitmaps) stored in the format Native, Index8, RGB565
*     or Screen. If the support is not included, the respective value is 0.
*     Whether particular surface type is supported does depend primarily on the
*     version of the Graphics Engine. By defining one of the following macros
*     during the compilation of the Graphics Engine, the support can be removed
*     or added explicitly: EW_DONT_USE_NATIVE_SURFACES,
*     EW_DONT_USE_INDEX8_SURFACES, EW_DONT_USE_RGB565_SURFACES,
*     EW_USE_PIXEL_FORMAT_SCREEN.
*

*
* DESCRIPTION:
*   The following type declares a prototype for a worker function, which should
*   perform the low level software 'blur pixel sequence' operation. Please note,
*   unlike other worker functions, this version is not limitted to perform the
*   operation row-wise. The pixel can also be read/written column-wise.
*
*   The funcion calculates the blur effect for the given number of pixel within
*   the destination surface. Due to the blur effect, the source read operations
*   may involve more source pixel before and after the sequence. The larger the
*   blur radius, the more source pixel are involved.
*
* ARGUMENTS:
*   aDst     - Pointer to the first pixel of the destination sequence.
*   aSrc     - Pointer to the first pixel of the source sequence.
*   aCount   - Length of the sequence in pixel.
*   aLimit1,
*   aLimit2  - Offsets to the first and to the last pixel within the current row
*     calculated relative to the address specified in aSrc. The blur algorithm
*     considers only source pixel lying within this area as valid. Any further
*     pixel beyond this limit is considered as being transparent.
*   aClamp1  - Number of source pixel preceding this first pixel of the sequence
*     from where the algorithm starts to clamp the blur effect. With the clamp
*     the blur effect ends abruptly.
*   aClamp2  - Number of source pixel following this first pixel of the sequence
*     from where the algorithm starts to clamp the blur effect. With the clamp
*     the blur effect ends abruptly.
*   aRadius  - Blur radius in pixel.
*   aOpacity - Modulates the opacity of the pixel data resulting from the blur
*     operation. This parameter can take values in range of 0 .. 255.
*   aBlend   - If != 0, the drawn pixel will be alpha-blended with the pixel in

*   the top-level function EwFilterBitmap().
*
* ARGUMENTS:
*   aDstHandle      - Handle to the screen/native destination surface.
*   aSrcHandle      - Handle to the native/index8/alpha8/rgb565 source surface.
*   aMaskHandle     - Handle to the alpha8 mask surface or NULL.
*   aDstX,
*   aDstY,
*   aDstWidth,
*   aDstHeight      - Area affected by the drawing operation (relative to the
*     top-left corner of the destination surface).
*   aSrcX,
*   aSrcY,
*   aSrcWidth,
*   aSrcHeight      - Area within the source surface relative to its top-left
*     corner to use as source.
*   aSrcPosX,
*   aSrcPosY        - Position within the source surface to map to the origin
*    (top-left corner) of the destination area (aDstX,aDstY).
*   aMaskPosX,
*   aMaskPosY       - Position within the mask surface to map to the origin
*     (top-left corner) of the destination area (aDstX,aDstY).
*   aClipX,
*   aClipY,
*   aClipWidth,
*   aClipHeight     - Area to limit the drawing operation (Relative to the top-
*     left corner of the destination surface).
*   aMaskInverted   - This parameter controls how pixel data from the surface
*     specified in the parameter aMaskHandle are evaluated. If aMaskInverted is
*     'true', the data from the mask are inverted resulting in opaque pixel
*     wherever the mask does contain a transparent pixel and transparent pixel
*     wherever an opaque pixel is found in the mask surface. Areas outside the
*     mask surface are conseqently considered as opaque when aMaskInverted is
*     set 'true'.
*   aMaskBeforeBlur - The parameter aMaskBeforeBlur controls the order in which
*     mask and blur operations are performed. If aMaskBeforeBlur is 'false',
*     the mask is applied after the blur effect. This allows the blur effect to
*     be clipped by the mask. If aMaskBeforeBlur is 'true', the blur effect is
*     applied on previously masked image content. The blur effect considers the
*     masked out areas as being transparent which allows the edges between the
*     regular and masked out areas to appear blurred.
*   aBlurRadius     - Determines the intensity of the blur filter effect. The
*     value is expressed in pixel as radius to blur the corresponding source
*     image content. If the value is <= 0, no blur filter is applied.
*   aBlurClampToEdges - Controls the blur effect at the edges of the source
*     surface. Providing 'true' in this parameter prevents the edges from being
*     transparent when the surface is aligned at edges of the destination area.
*   aMode           - This parameter controls the tint filter. Depending on
*     the selected value, the original colors found in the source surface are
*     modified or replaced by the value aColor. The intensity of the effect is
*     controlled by the parameter aIntensity. See EW_TINT_MODE_XXX for more
*     details.
*   aIntensity      - This parameter controls the intensity of the tint filter.
*     This value lies in range of 0.0 .. 1.0. If the value is 1.0, the original
*     colors are completely replaced by values resulting from the filter effect.
*     In turn, the value equal to zero results in the original color values
*     without any tinting effect. Otherwise the colors are interpolated between
*     the original and the color value resulting from the filter effect.
*   aColor          - A color value to be used by the tint filter. See aMode
*     parameter.

*      blending.

*   EwRasterAlpha8Polygon
*
* DESCRIPTION:
*  The function EwRasterAlpha8Polygon() implements an algorithm to estimate the
*  content of an ALPHA8 bitmap from polygon data determined by edges in the
*  array aPaths. aPaths stores the edges as a serie of X,Y pairs starting always
*  with a value specifying the number of existing edges. With this approach one
*  path can consist of several sub-paths. The end of the list is determined by a
*  sub-path with 0 edges.

*  | edges |  X0  |  Y0  |  X1  |  Y1  |  X2  |  Y2  | edges | ... |  0  |
*  +-------+------+------+------+------+------+------+-------+     +-----+
*
*  The function evaluates the path data for intersections between the edges and
*  the pixel within the destination area aDstX, aDstY, aWidth and aHeight. Then
*  the affected pixel are set or cleared according to whether they lie inside
*  or outside the polygon.
*
* ARGUMENTS:
*   aDst            - Pointer to the first pixel of the destination ALPHA8
*     surface. The caller is responsable for clearing the surface before.
*   aPaths          - An array containing the path data. The array starts with
*     the number of edges a path is composed of. Then follow the coordinates of
*     all path corners as X,Y pairs. After the last coordinate pair next path
*     can follow starting again with the number of edges. The end of the path
*     data is signed with 0. The X,Y coordinates are stored as signed integer
*     with 4-bit fixpoint precision. The coordinates are valid relative to the
*     top-left corner of the destination area aDstX, aDstY.
*   aDstX,
*   aDstY           - Origin of the area to fill (relative to the top-left
*     corner of the destination surface).

*   aX, aY          - Path coordinate at the top-left corner of aDstX, aDstY
*     area. This value is expressed in in 4-bit fixpoint precision.
*   aAntialiased    - If != 0, the function applies antialiasing to the pixel.
*     The antialiasing is based on supersampling with 4 samples in X and Y
*     direction.
*   aNonZeroWinding - Controls the fill rule to be used by the algorithm. If

* FUNCTION:
*   EwEmulateBlurMaskTintFilter
*
* DESCRIPTION:
*   The function EwEmulateBlurMaskTintFilter() drives a copy operation with blur
*   filter followed by a mask or tint filter between a native or alpha8 surface
*   as source and a screen or native surface as destination.
*
*   The function provides the top-level interface to the software pixel driver.
*   The real drawing operation will be driven by the passed worker functions.
*
*   Please note, the function performs a single blur pass by reading the pixel
*   row-wise from the source surface, bluring them and storing the results as
*   columns in the destination surface. The rows and columns are thus exchanged
*   after the operation is done. Repeating the operation again restores the
*   original order.
*
* ARGUMENTS:
*   aDst          - Pointer to the first pixel of the destination surface.
*   aSrc          - Pointer to the first pixel of the source surface.
*   aMask         - Pointer to the first pixel of the mask surface or NULL if
*     no mask is used.
*   aAux          - Pointer to the first pixel of an auxiliary surface used to
*     store the results of a blurred column before it is processed by the mask/
*     tint filter. The layout of the auxiliary surface has to be as wide as the
*     height of the destination surface and contain one row only. The format of
*     the surface has to be native or alpha8 if the source is alpha8 too.
*   aDstX,
*   aDstY         - Origin of the area to fill (relative to the top-left corner
*     of the destination surface).
*   aWidth,
*   aHeight       - Size of the area to fill.
*   aSrcX,
*   aSrcY         - Position within the source surface to map to the origin of
*     the destination area (relative to the top-left corner of the source
*     surface).
*   aSrcX1..
*   aSrcX2        - Horizontal boundary within the source surface indicating
*     the area to use as source. Source pixel outside this boundary are 
*     considered as transparent.
*   aMaskX,
*   aMaskY        - Position within the mask surface to map to the origin of
*     the destination area (relative to the top-left corner of the mask
*     surface).
*   aMaskX1..
*   aMaskY2       - Boundary within the mask surface indicating the area to use
*     as mask. The area outside the mask boundary is considered as transparent.
*   aMaskInverted - If aMaskInverted != 0, the data from the mask surface is
*     inverted and the area outside the mask boundary is considered as opaque.
*     Please note: if mask is used and the mask is not inverted, the resulting
*     drawing area may not be larger than the mask area!
*   aColor        - A color value to be used by the tint filter stored in a
*     XGradient data structure.
*   aIntensity    - This parameter controls the intensity of the tint filter.
*     This value lies in range of 0 .. 255. If the value is 255, the original
*     colors are completely replaced by values resulting from the filter. If
*     the value is equal zero, the original colors are used.
*   aClamp1..
*   aClamp2       - Vertical boundary relative to the first row in the 
*     destination area from where the algorithm starts to clamp the blur effect.
*   aRadius       - Blur radius in pixel.
*   aOpacity      - Modulates the opacity of the pixel data resulting from the
*     blur/mask/tint operation. This parameter can take values in range of 0 ..
*     255.
*   aBlend        - If != 0, the drawn pixel will be alpha-blended with the
*     pixel in the background.
*   aWorker1      - Worker used to blur between the source and the auxiliary
*     surface. The source and the auxiliary surfaces are both either NATIVE or
*     ALPHA8.
*   aWorker2      - Worker used to blur between the source and the destination
*     surface. The source surface is NATIVE. Destination surface is either
*     NATIVE or SCREEN.
*   aWorker3      - Low-level worker functions to perform the mask/tint filter
*     operation column-wise between the auxiliary and the destination surfaces.
*   aWorker4      - Worker optimized to perform only the tint operation between
*     the auxiliary and the destination surfaces. This worker will be used for
*     areas lying outside the mask when the mask is inverted.
*   aWorker5      - Worker optimized to perform only a copy operation between
*     the auxiliary and the destination surfaces. This worker will be used for
*     areas lying outside the mask when the mask is inverted and no tint filter
*     is used.

* FUNCTION:
*   EwEmulateFillPolygon
*
* DESCRIPTION:
*  The function EwEmulateFillPolygon() drives a fill polygon operation with
*  polygon data provided in the array aPaths. aPaths stores polygon edges as a
*  serie of X,Y coordinate pairs starting always with a value specifying the
*  number of edges the path is composed of. With this approach one path can
*  consist of several sub-paths. The end of the list is determined by a sub-
*  path with 0 edges:
*
*  +-------+------+------+------+------+------+------+-------+     +-----+
*  | edges |  X0  |  Y0  |  X1  |  Y1  |  X2  |  Y2  | edges | ... |  0  |
*  +-------+------+------+------+------+------+------+-------+     +-----+
*
*  The function evaluates the path data for intersections between the edges and
*  the pixel within the destination area aDstX, aDstY, aWidth and aHeight. The
*  function modulates the pixel by solid or gradient color values.
*
*  The function provides the top-level interface to the software pixel driver.
*  The real drawing operation will be driven by the passed worker function.
*
* ARGUMENTS:
*   aDst            - Pointer to the first pixel of the destination surface.
*   aPaths          - An array containing the path data. The array starts with
*     the number of edges a path is composed of. Then follow the coordinates of
*     all path corners as X,Y pairs. After the last coordinate pair next path
*     can follow starting again with the number of edges. The end of the path
*     data is signed with 0. The X,Y coordinates are stored as signed integer
*     with 4-bit fixpoint precision. The coordinates are valid relative to the
*     top-left corner of the destination bitmap.
*   aDstX,
*   aDstY           - Origin of the area to fill (relative to the top-left
*     corner of the destination surface).
*   aWidth,
*   aHeight         - Size of the area to fill.
*   aAntialiased    - If != 0, the function applies antialiasing to the pixel.
*     The antialiasing is based on supersampling with 4 samples in X and Y
*     direction.
*   aNonZeroWinding - Controls the fill rule to be used by the algorithm. If
*    this parameter is == 0, the even-odd fill rule is used. If this parameter
*    is != 0, the non-zero winding rule is used.
*   aGradient       - Color information to modulate the copied pixel.
*   aGrdX,
*   aGrdY           - Origin of the affected area in the gradient coordinate
*     space.
*   aWorker         - Low-level worker function to perform the final copy
*     operation of the rasterized pixel row-wise.

* FUNCTION:

*
* DESCRIPTION:
*   The following EwPackColor() function has the job to convert the given RGBA
*   color channels into a generic packed 32 bit format as it is used internally
*   by the Graphics Engine.
*
*   The generic packed 32 bit color format provides an abstraction of a 32 bit
*   color value consisting of three color channels and one alpha channel. The
*   content of the three color chanels is a subject of the particular target
*   system - Graphics Engine doesn't need to know anything about the meaning of
*   these channels - they are abstract.
*
*   The generic packed 32 bit color format stores the channels in the following
*   order:
*
*              31           24           16             8            0

*               |   alpha    |  channel 3 |  channel 2  |  channel 1 |
*               +------------+---------------------------------------+
*
*   Depending on the target color format, the function can modify and convert
*   the values of the channels. For example, the RGB -> YUV conversion can be
*   executed or the color channels can be pre-multiplied by the alpha value.
*
*   The resulting 32 bit value is particular for the respective target color
*   format. It is predestined to be used more effectively durring all drawing
*   operations.
*
* ARGUMENTS:
*   aRed,
*   aGreen,
*   aBlue,
*   aAlpha  - Non-premultiplied color channel values in the range 0 .. 255.

* FUNCTION:
*   EwFilterNative
*   EwScreenFilterNative
*
* DESCRIPTION:
*   The following functions define the low-level, pixel-wise drawing operation
*   to copy the contents from the native source surface, modulate the opacity
*   of the resulting pixel by the value aOpacity and finally write the results
*   into the destination surface or blend the results with the contents found
*   in the destination surface if aBlend is != 0.
*
*   This operation is in fact not a filter. It is like a copy transfer. However
*   the particularity of this version is the addresing within the destination
*   surface. Depending on the parameters stored in aDst, the worker can write
*   the pixel column-wise into the destination while reading the pixel row-wise
*   from the source. This mode is obligatory for all mask/tint filter worker
*   when these follow the blur filter. The blur filter changes the row/column
*   layout of the processed pixel.
*
* ARGUMENTS:
*   aDst          - Pointer to the first pixel of the destination row.
*   aSrc          - Pointer to the first pixel of the source row.
*   aMask         - Always NULL.
*   aWidth        - Length of the row in pixel.
*   aColor        - Always NULL.
*   aIntensity    - Always 0.
*   aOpacity      - Modulates the opacity of the read source pixel data. This
*     parameter can take values in range of 0 .. 255.
*   aBlend        - If != 0, the drawn pixel will be alpha-blended with the
*     pixel in the background.

* RETURN VALUE:
*   None

*
* DESCRIPTION:
*   The following functions define the low-level, pixel-wise drawing operation
*   to tint the contents from the rgb565 source surface by a color value found
*   in aGradient, mask the contents using a mask surface, modulate the opacity
*   of the resulting pixel by the value aOpacity and finally write the results
*   into the destination surface or blend the results with the contents found
*   in the destination surface if aBlend is != 0.
*
* ARGUMENTS:
*   aDst          - Pointer to the first pixel of the destination row.
*   aSrc          - Pointer to the first pixel of the source row.
*   aMask         - Pointer to the first pixel of the mask row or NULL if no
*     mask is used.
*   aWidth        - Length of the row in pixel.
*   aColor        - A color value to be used by the tint filter stored in a
*     XGradient data structure.
*   aIntensity    - This parameter controls the intensity of the tint filter.
*     This value lies in range of 0 .. 255. If the value is 255, the original
*     colors are completely replaced by values resulting from the filter. If
*     the value is equal zero, the original colors are used.
*   aOpacity      - Modulates the opacity of the pixel data resulting from the
*     filter operation. This parameter can take values in range of 0 .. 255.
*   aBlend        - If != 0, the drawn pixel will be alpha-blended with the
*     pixel in the background.
*
* RETURN VALUE:
*   None

*   EwScreenFilterNativeBlur
*
* DESCRIPTION:
*   The following type declares a prototype for a worker function, which should
*   perform the low level software 'blur pixel sequence' operation from a native
*   to a native or screen surface. Please note, unlike other worker functions,
*   this version is not limitted to perform the operation row-wise. The pixel
*   can also be read/written column-wise.
*
*   The funcion calculates the blur effect for the given number of pixel within
*   the destination surface. Due to the blur effect, the source read operations
*   may involve more source pixel before and after the sequence. The larger the
*   blur radius, the more source pixel are involved.
*
*   Please note, for performance reasons, the Graphics Engine applies the so-
*   called box-blur algorithm. Here, the pixel enclosed within the the blur
*   area are simply accumulated and the resulting sum is divided by the number
*   of accumulated pixel.
*
* ARGUMENTS:
*   aDst     - Pointer to the first pixel of the destination sequence.
*   aSrc     - Pointer to the first pixel of the source sequence.
*   aCount   - Length of the sequence in pixel.
*   aLimit1,
*   aLimit2  - Offsets to the first and to the last pixel within the current row
*     calculated relative to the address specified in aSrc. The blur algorithm
*     considers only source pixel lying within this area as valid. Any further
*     pixel beyond this limit is considered as being transparent.
*   aClamp1  - Number of source pixel preceding this first pixel of the sequence
*     from where the algorithm starts to clamp the blur effect. With the clamp
*     the blur effect ends abruptly.
*   aClamp2  - Number of source pixel following this first pixel of the sequence
*     from where the algorithm starts to clamp the blur effect. With the clamp
*     the blur effect ends abruptly.
*   aRadius  - Blur radius in pixel.
*   aOpacity - Modulates the opacity of the pixel data resulting from the blur
*     operation. This parameter can take values in range of 0 .. 255.
*   aBlend   - If != 0, the drawn pixel will be alpha-blended with the pixel in
